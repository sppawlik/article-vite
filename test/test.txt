### Navigating ESG Reporting for SMEs: Ensuring Proportionality in Compliance

The evolving landscape of ESG reporting for SMEs on regulated markets raises a critical question: How can we ensure proportionality in compliance requirements? This is the crux of the [recent discussion](https://example.com) initiated by the Association of Stock Exchange Issuers (SEG) with the European Commission. As the deadline for the revised LSME standard approaches in December 2024, SEG emphasizes the need for balanced requirements for SMEs.

The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) is working on a revised LSME standard, proposing around 250 mandatory disclosures, contingent on a double materiality assessment. In contrast, a voluntary ESG reporting standard for unlisted SMEs is being developed, aiming for approximately 100 disclosures. This disparity highlights a potential imbalance in the regulatory burden placed on listed SMEs.

> "The CSRD directive did not condition the scope of disclosures on whether a company is listed on a regulated market or not," SEG points out, underscoring that both listed and unlisted large entities will report under full ESRS, irrespective of their market status.

This brings us to the heart of the matter: the principle of proportionality. The CSRD directive's intent was to ensure that micro-entities, even if listed, are exempt from ESG reporting obligations, aligning them with other micro-units. However, the separation of simplified standards into LSME and VSME introduces a disproportionate burden on listed SMEs.

SEG's call to action is clear: the European Commission should rigorously apply the 'SME test' outlined in the EU's "Better Regulation Toolbox" from July 2023. This test is crucial for ensuring that the regulatory framework remains fair and proportionate, particularly as we move towards formalizing the LSME standard into EU law.

For ESG professionals, this ongoing dialogue underscores the importance of advocating for balanced regulatory approaches that consider the unique challenges faced by SMEs. Staying informed and engaged with these discussions will be key to navigating the complexities of ESG compliance effectively.
